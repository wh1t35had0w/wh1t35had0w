Hey there! 👋

I’m wh1t35had0w, a Red Team practitioner in training.

I study how systems fail — not from theory, but from the attacker’s side.
If there’s an assumption, I test it.
If there’s trust, I try to break it.

My focus is offensive security: adversary simulation, post-exploitation, and abusing real-world misconfigurations.
I spend most of my time in labs, CTFs, and controlled environments learning how attackers actually move.

My current toolkit revolves around Linux, Windows internals, networking fundamentals, and scripting.
I enjoy building small tools, breaking environments, and documenting what I learn.

I’ve got a few pinned repositories — most of them are experiments, notes, and red team learning artifacts.
This profile is less about polish and more about progress.

Fun facts:

I think enumeration is underrated

Silence is usually success

I prefer terminals over GUIs

Hobbies: labs, CTFs, breaking things (ethically)
